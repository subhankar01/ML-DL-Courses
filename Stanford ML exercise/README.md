## Word of Caution and a Genuine Request as a Mentor❗️

Please do not blindly copy paste the solutions just for the sake of completing the course. Please refer to these solutions only when you face some doubt or couldn't figure out things at all. This is a genuine request from my side. This is to ensure better learning and proper grasp of concept in the field of Machine learning. No shortcuts! 🚫😎

Thank You !😊
